# Note: This tool primarily uses Python's standard library (subprocess, argparse, pathlib).
# The main external dependency is FFmpeg, which must be installed separately on the system.
#
# FFmpeg installation:
# - macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
# - Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

# No Python package dependencies required for core functionality
# All imports use standard library modules
